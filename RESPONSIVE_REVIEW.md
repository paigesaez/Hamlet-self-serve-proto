## Current Responsive Breakpoints
- **sm:** 640px+ (tablets)
- **md:** 768px+ (small laptops)  
- **lg:** 1024px+ (desktops)

## Current Responsive Patterns Found

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Grid Layouts** - Using `lg:grid-cols-2` for two-column layouts on desktop
2. **Padding/Spacing** - Responsive padding like `p-6 sm:p-8`
3. **Text Sizes** - Scaling text with `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl`
4. **Button Layouts** - Stacking on mobile with `flex-col sm:flex-row`
5. **Button Sizing** - Full width on mobile with `w-full sm:w-auto`

### ❌ Common Issues to Fix

1. **Navigation Buttons**
   - Text might be too small on mobile (`text-sm sm:text-base`)
   - Buttons should be larger tap targets on mobile

2. **Form Inputs**
   - Need larger touch targets on mobile
   - Should have more padding on small screens

3. **Grid Gaps**
   - `gap-8` might be too large on mobile
   - Consider `gap-4 sm:gap-6 lg:gap-8`

4. **Card Padding**
   - `p-6 sm:p-8` is good but could use `p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8`

5. **Text Hierarchy**
   - Headers might be too large on mobile
   - Body text could be more readable

6. **Step Indicator**
   - Likely gets cramped on mobile
   - May need a mobile-specific design

7. **Long Lists** (Jurisdiction/Topic Selection)
   - Need better mobile scrolling
   - Touch-friendly selection areas

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Mobile-First Base Styles
```css
/* Larger tap targets */
min-height: 44px for all interactive elements

/* Better mobile spacing */
padding: 1rem on mobile, scaling up

/* Readable text */
base font-size: 16px minimum
```

### 2. Form Improvements

### 3. Navigation Improvements

- Progress indicator that works on small screens

### 4. Content Prioritization

### 5. Testing Viewports
