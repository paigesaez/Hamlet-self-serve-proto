## üìù **Project Instructions**

### General Guidelines
- Always read through the entire file when told to read through the entire file, so you get full context and make less mistakes
- Always keep tabs and update docs
- Always verify your work: You are my lead engineer. Assume the following mindset for a production SaaS: fix root causes, test after each fix, but also ensure the whole pipeline is robust and not just "patched" in one spot. This is a holistic, lead-engineer-level approach.
- Always use descriptive variable names
- Always verify and unit test your work to ensure code quality, reliability, and catch potential issues early in the development process

### Important Instruction Reminders
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## üîç **Application Audit Findings**

### **Architecture & Code Quality**
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Single-file React component with clean functional architecture
- Well-structured step-based flow with clear state management
- Modular component design (CoverageBuilder, EmailCapture, BillingInfo)
- Consistent naming conventions and code organization
- Good separation of concerns between UI and logic

‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas for Improvement:**
- Component is 958 lines - could benefit from splitting into separate files
- Mock data is hardcoded - should move to API/external data source
- No TypeScript interfaces for complex objects (locations, topics, billingInfo)
- Missing custom hooks for form state management

### **State Management**
‚úÖ **Current Implementation:**
- Uses React useState hooks effectively
- State is properly scoped to components
- Clean state reset functionality
- Proper state updates with immutability

‚ö†Ô∏è **Improvements Needed:**
- Consider useReducer for complex multi-step form state
- No persistence layer - form progress is lost on refresh
- Could benefit from context API for deeply nested state passing

### **UI/UX & Accessibility**
‚úÖ **Well Implemented:**
- Clear visual hierarchy and professional design
- Consistent color scheme using brand colors (#002147)
- Good use of icons (Lucide React) for visual clarity

## üñ•Ô∏è **Claude CLI Local Installation Setup**

### **Overview**
This project is configured to use a local Claude CLI installation to avoid conflicts with global installations and ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

### **Installation Structure**
The local Claude installation is located at:
- **Installation Path:** `~/.claude/local/`
- **Executable:** `~/.claude/local/claude`
- **Node Modules:** `~/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/`

### **Shell Configuration Files**
The following shell configuration files have been created to ensure the local Claude installation is always used:

1. **`.zshrc`** (Primary shell - macOS default)
   ```bash
   # Claude local installation configuration
   export PATH="$HOME/.claude/local:$PATH"
   alias claude="$HOME/.claude/local/claude"
   
   # Source .zprofile if it exists (for brew and other configs)
   [ -f ~/.zprofile ] && source ~/.zprofile
   ```

2. **`.bash_profile`** (Bash compatibility)
   ```bash
   # Claude local installation configuration for bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.claude/local:$PATH"
   alias claude="$HOME/.claude/local/claude"
   
   # Source .bashrc if it exists
   [ -f ~/.bashrc ] && source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **`.profile`** (POSIX shell compatibility)
   ```bash
   # Claude local installation configuration for POSIX shells
   export PATH="$HOME/.claude/local:$PATH"
   alias claude="$HOME/.claude/local/claude"
   ```

### **Settings Configuration**
The project includes a `.claude/settings.local.json` file with:
- IDE auto-connect configuration
- Permission settings for allowed bash commands
- MCP server configuration

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **Verify Installation**
To verify the local installation is being used:
```bash
which claude  # Should show: /Users/[username]/.claude/local/claude
claude --version
```

#### **Common Issues**

1. **Command not found after setup**
   - Solution: Source your shell configuration or open a new terminal
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc  # For zsh
   source ~/.bash_profile  # For bash
   ```

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Solution: Ensure the claude executable has proper permissions
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.claude/local/claude
   ```

3. **Multiple installations conflict**
   - Check for multiple installations: `claude doctor`
   - The local installation should take precedence due to PATH ordering

4. **IDE not auto-connecting**
   - Ensure `.claude/settings.local.json` contains:
   ```json
   "mcp": {
     "servers": {
       "ide": {
         "command": "auto-connect"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### **Maintenance**
- The local installation is self-contained in `~/.claude/local/`
- Updates can be managed via npm: `cd ~/.claude/local && npm update`
- Shell configurations ensure persistence across system restarts
